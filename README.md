# Project Title: Unemployment Rate Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the unemployment rate in the United States, focusing on various factors such as the impact of AI, industry sectors, education levels, and the effects of COVID-19.

## Areas of Investigation

### Mareme's Focus: Impact of AI on the Labor Market
1. **Impact of AI in the Past 10 Years**
   - Has AI had a positive or negative impact on the labor market?
   - Which areas are most affected by AI?
   - Projections for the next 5 years using Prophet.

### Frank's Focus: Unemployment and Economy/Industry Sectors
1. **Unemployment and Industry Sectors**
   - How does unemployment vary across different industry sectors?
   Unemployment is often affected differently across various industry sectors, as economic conditions, technological advances, globalization, and other factors impact sectors in unique ways. Here’s an overview of how unemployment trends might vary across industries and why:
   1. Cyclicality of the Industry
      Highly Cyclical Industries:
         Sectors like construction, manufacturing, and hospitality are often more sensitive to economic cycles.
         During recessions, demand for discretionary goods and services drops, causing layoffs in these industries.
         For example, construction projects may be delayed or canceled, and manufacturing plants may scale down operations.
         Resilient Industries:
         Sectors like healthcare, education, and utilities are less affected by economic downturns because they provide essential services that remain in demand.
   2. Technology and Automation
      Industries Vulnerable to Automation:
         Manufacturing, retail, and transportation are particularly affected by technological advancements that replace human labor with machines or AI.
         This can lead to structural unemployment, where workers' skills no longer match job requirements.
      Industries Benefiting from Technology:
         Technology, finance, and renewable energy sectors often see job growth due to innovation, requiring a skilled workforce.
   3. Pandemics and Disruptions
   Pandemic-Impacted Sectors:
         The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected sectors like travel, hospitality, entertainment, and retail due to lockdowns and reduced consumer spending.
         At the same time, demand surged in sectors like e-commerce, healthcare, and logistics.
   
   - How do unemployment rates differ by education level (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree)?

   Unemployment rates tend to vary significantly by education level, as higher levels of education often correlate with better job prospects, lower unemployment rates, and higher wages. Here's an overview of how education level impacts unemployment, and how you can analyze it using data:

   General Trends in Unemployment by Education Level:
   1. Lower Education Levels:

   Individuals without a high school diploma often experience the highest unemployment rates.
   Jobs available to this group are often low-skill and vulnerable to economic downturns, outsourcing, and automation.

   2. High School Graduates (No College):
      The unemployment rate is lower than for those without a diploma but higher than for those with college education.
      Many jobs in this category are in industries like construction, manufacturing, and retail.

   3. Some College or Associate's Degree:

      This group typically experiences moderate unemployment rates, as additional education or technical training improves employability.
      Common industries include healthcare, IT support, and skilled trades.
   
   4. Bachelor's Degree and Higher:

      Individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher have the lowest unemployment rates, as they often qualify for high-skill, high-demand jobs.
      Industries such as finance, technology, healthcare, and education dominate.

   - How do unemployment rates for different education levels vary by region or state?
      In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports unemployment rates by race/ethnicity in its Current Population Survey (CPS). The main racial/ethnic categories include:

         Black or African American: Consistently higher unemployment rates compared to other groups.
         Hispanic or Latino: Higher rates than White workers but often lower than Black workers.
         White: Lower unemployment rates overall.
         Asian: Lower unemployment rates but with significant diversity within the group.
      
   - How do changes in technology and industry demands influence the relationship between education levels and unemployment rates?
   1. Demand for Higher Education and Specialized Skills
         Technological Advancements:
            Automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning have replaced many routine, manual, or low-skill jobs (e.g., assembly line work, data entry). This displacement disproportionately affects workers with lower education levels.
            In contrast, industries like technology, healthcare, and engineering require specialized skills and higher education, favoring those with bachelor’s degrees or higher.
         STEM Fields:
            Growth in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations has created opportunities for highly educated workers, further widening the gap in unemployment rates between those with and without higher education.
   2. Digital Divide and Inequity
         Access to Technology:
            The digital divide disproportionately affects lower-educated workers, who may lack the resources or skills to adapt to technology-driven jobs.
            Online job applications and remote work opportunities often favor tech-savvy individuals with higher education levels.
   3. Economic Shocks and Accelerated Trends
         COVID-19 Pandemic:
            Accelerated the adoption of remote work and automation.
            Workers in jobs requiring in-person presence (e.g., retail, hospitality) faced significant layoffs. Those with higher education were more likely to adapt to remote work and retain employment.
